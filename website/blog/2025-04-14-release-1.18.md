## Release Details

### Docker Compatibilty mode page is out of experimental mode ðŸŽ‰

The experimental Docker Compatibility feature page that was introduced in [v1.13](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.13#docker-compatibility-mode-page) has been moved out of experimental mode, so now everything related to Docker compatibility can be found in one place for you to use. In addition, new Docker compatibility related notifications have been added to make the set up process easier and less guesswork when running into problems.

  }}
/>

    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/docker-socket-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>

### Switching Kubernetes namepaces

Until now, only switching Kubernetes context was supported in Podman Dekstop. But no more, as now users are also able to switch between namespaces from within Podman Desktop without having to do anything outside the app. The selection does not modify Kube config, and is presistent across the app, so if you select a specific namespace in one place, it will be used everywhere else in Podman Desktop.

    light: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/Kubernetes-namespaces-light.png').default,
    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/Kubernetes-namespaces-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>

### Kubernetes Jobs

As part of our ongoing Kubernetes improvment and enhancemnt efforts, a new tab has been added for Kubernetes Jobs. You can now view the jobs, all in one place, with details page for each one, and the ability to delete and view completion statuses.

    light: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/Kubernetes-jobs-light.png').default,
    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/Kubernetes-jobs-dark.png').default,
  }}
/> -->

### Experimental statusbar providers enhancments

The experimental statusbar providers that were introduced in [v1.16](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.16#providers-appear-in-the-status-bar) have undergone some changes to make them easier to understand and use.

The new provider status icons include:

- white dot - running
- red dot - error
- up arrow - update available
- spinning circle - stopping or starting
- darker icon - stopped

In addition, you can now choose which available providers to show by pinning or un-pinning them from the statusbar:

    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/statusbar-provider-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>
