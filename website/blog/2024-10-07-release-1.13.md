## Release Details

### HyperV support

Podman Desktop is now supporting the creation and modification of HyperV based Podman machines in Windows directly from the app.
When creating a podman machine in Windows, if both HyperV and WSL are enabled, you can choose either one of them as the provider from the dropdown menu.

### Search image feature

Want to pull an image but forgot its full name or tag? Now when pulling an image, a list of possible images is shown based on the provided input to make it easier for your to find and pull the right image. Just enter an image name and look for the right one in the list. If you would like to search for a specific tag, just add : to the name.

### Updated empty state pages

We have updated the empty state pages for images, containers, pods, and Kubernetes. You can now pull your first image, create your first container or pod, all with only one click.

### New Kubernetes navigation

As we grow our Kubernetes section and add new Kubernetes related pages, its navigation could become a bit crowded. For better user exprience, this release includes a new Kubernetes sub menu with all the relevant pages in it.
